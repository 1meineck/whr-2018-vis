        filter (25% of screenWidth) - map (50%) - radar(25%)
        overview (25%) - 3 radar(25%)


    -> Still Errors for Congo(Kinshasa) --> fix or ignore..

    (also, with the filtering, there is still the problem of countries, for wich we have no data at all.. 
    (not) coloring them the same as the data, which is filtered out might be confusing, but I don't really now if there is a good alternative ^^')

    -> Add text to radars to show data
